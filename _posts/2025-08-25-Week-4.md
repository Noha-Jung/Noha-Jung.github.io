# Data Science News
This week I'll be sharing an article by Zackary Nay who compares KDE vs. Normalizing Flows and why MAF wins in higher dimensions.

One of the biggest challenges in high-dimensional density estimation is the curse of dimensionality: as dimensions grow, data becomes sparse, and models like [Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)](https://towardsdatascience.com/kernel-density-estimation-explained-step-by-step-7cc5b5bc4517/) need exponentially more samples to stay accurate. For example, while 22 samples are enough for 1D, over 360,000 are needed in 6D, and over a million in 8D.

KDE works well in low dimensions because it estimates density locally using nearby data points. But as space expands, this local approach breaks down. Bandwidth selection also becomes harder, often requiring computationally heavy methods like leave-one-out cross-validation.

A promising alternative is Normalizing Flows, specifically [Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF)](https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-implement-masked-autoregressive-flow-with-tensorflow-9c361cd1354c/). Instead of relying on local neighborhoods, MAF starts with a simple distribution (like a Gaussian) and reshapes it through a series of invertible, differentiable transformations. This global, function-based approach lets MAF generalize without needing to “fill” the space with data points.

In experiments, both KDE and MAF were trained until they achieved a KL divergence of 0.5 across different distributions. Results showed a clear pattern:
<ul>
  <li>Below 5 dimensions, KDE often performed better.</li>

  <li>Above 5 dimensions, MAF vastly outperformed KDE, needing up to 100x fewer samples. For instance, at 7D KDE required over 100,000 samples, while MAF needed just 2,000. MAF also trained about 12x faster.</li>
</ul>

KDE remains an excellent tool for low dimensional problems, but for higher dimensional tasks, MAF is both more data-efficient and computationally effective. If your application involves more than 5 dimensions, MAF is the clear winner.
