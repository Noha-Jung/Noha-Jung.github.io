<p>I've decided to make a blog for the weekly reflections to make things a bit more interesting. At the start of each post, I'll also be including a "weekly data science news" section to spice things up, and these can range from data science news that are occuring now, or anything I find related to data science that I feel like is worth sharing</p>
